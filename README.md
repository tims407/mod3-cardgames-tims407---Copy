Gibson's Prospector Solitaire

This contains a blend of code from the 1st and 2nd edition of the book. 

The processes of making the cards was broken out in to separate functions - AddDecorators, AddPips, AddFace, etc. In the 1st edition the code contained all of these processes within the MakeCard function.

If you go through the second edtion of the text, the code will not match up, but the cards will all be made and the deck is the same at the end of the process.
